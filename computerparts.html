It is basically the brains the of computer. It follows instructions which make the computer work. The speed at which it can read and execute the instructions is known at clockspeed. It is mesured in Ghz, usually the higher the Ghz the faster the CPU is.</td>

Cores help CPUs execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This can be increased even further by overclocking, however it does generate heat and may damage the CPU if used too often. Certain CPUs will have pins on them, bending these pins could result in the CPU not working.</td>

It handles graphics in things like video games and is not actually needed for a computer to function. It can be compared to as a CPU but for graphically intense tasks, hence the name.</td>
